# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for. This project aims to create a communication channel between Babylon.js and Blender, enabling users to use Babylon.js as a view layer and Blender for rendering. The communication is facilitated through WebSockets and a REST API, implemented with Python Flask.

## Description

This project integrates Babylon.js with Blender to provide real-time rendering capabilities and interactive 3D visualizations. It is designed to allow users to dynamically control Blender render settings through a web interface powered by Babylon.js, making it easier to create and visualize 3D scenes online. By leveraging WebSockets for real-time communication and a REST API for structured data exchange, this solution offers a seamless bridge between the user interface and the rendering backend.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Flask
- Blender 2.9x or newer
- Babylon.js 4.x or compatible version

### Installing

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory and set up a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Executing Program
To start the Flask server, run:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the server on the default port (usually 5000), making the API accessible through http://localhost:5000.

API Reference
Request Format
Send JSON formatted requests to the Flask server to interact with Blender. Here is an example of the JSON request format:

json
Copy code
{
    "material_id": 1,
    "product_id": 1,
    "scene_id": 1,
    "cameraData": {
        "position": { "x": 9.9, "z": -2.9, "y": -2.7 },
        "target": { "x": 1.7, "y": 1, "z": 1.44 },
        "rotation": { "x": 61, "y": -51, "z": 12 }
    }
}
Response Format
Responses will be JSON formatted and include any data or status information related to the request.

Usage Examples
